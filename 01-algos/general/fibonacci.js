/* 
  Fibonacci
  Implement the Fibonacci function, a famous mathematical
  equation that generates a numerical sequence such that
  each number is the sum of the previous two.
  
  The Fibonacci numbers at index 0 and 1, coincidentally,
  have values of 0 and 1. Your function should accept an
  argument `idx` and return the Fibonacci number at that
  index.

  Examples:
  ​fibonacci(2)​ = 1
  fibonacci(3)​ = 2
  ​fibonacci(4)​ = 3
  ​fibonacci(5)​ = 5
