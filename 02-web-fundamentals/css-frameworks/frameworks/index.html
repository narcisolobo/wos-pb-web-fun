        <h2>Types of CSS Frameworks</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Classless / Minimalist:</h3>
          <h4>Learning curve: Low, CSS file size: Light</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://oxal.org/projects/sakura/">Sakura</a>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These frameworks offer a minimal set of styles and components,
            focusing on simplicity and flexibility. They provide a starting
            point for customization rather than a complete UI solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're concerned about page load times and performance, a
            lightweight framework can be beneficial. These frameworks typically
            have smaller file sizes and fewer dependencies, resulting in faster
            loading times for your web pages. They focus on essential styles and
            components, minimizing the impact on performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Project Prototyping: When building a quick prototype or proof of
            concept, a lightweight framework can help you get started rapidly.
            Its minimalistic approach allows you to set up a basic structure and
            layout quickly, allowing you to focus more on the core functionality
            or design aspects of your project.

          <h3>Utility-First / Atomic:</h3>
          <h4>
            Learning curve: High, CSS file size: Light (if configured with
            postcss/purgecss)
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Atomic CSS libraries follow a modular approach, where styles are
            broken down into small, single-purpose utility classes. These
            classes represent individual styling properties, such as margin,
            padding, typography, colors, and positioning. The primary advantage
            of atomic CSS is that it allows for highly modular and reusable
            styles. This approach is beneficial when you want to create a large
            number of consistent and reusable styles across your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are building a custom design system for your project, an
            atomic CSS library can be a valuable tool. Atomic classes provide a
            shared language for defining and applying styles across your design
            system, ensuring visual consistency and ease of maintenance. It
            allows you to create a cohesive set of reusable styles that can be
            used consistently throughout your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Atomic CSS libraries offer a standardized set of utility classes
            that can be easily understood and adopted by a development team.
            This promotes consistency in styling and facilitates collaboration
            among team members, as they can quickly grasp and apply the atomic
            classes without extensive knowledge of CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Atomic CSS libraries excel in rapid prototyping scenarios. Since
            atomic classes are focused on specific styling properties, you can
            quickly assemble and apply them to elements without the need to
            write custom CSS rules. This speeds up the prototyping process,
            allowing you to iterate and experiment with different styles and
            layouts easily.

          <h3>Comprehensive / General Purpose:</h3>
          <h4>
            Learning curve: Mid, CSS file size: Mid-to-heavy, but can be light
            if configured with postcss/purgecss
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://get.foundation/">Foundation</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These frameworks provide a wide range of pre-designed components,
            layouts, and utility classes for building complete websites or web
            applications. They often include CSS, JavaScript, and sometimes
            additional tools for tasks like responsive design and cross-browser
            compatibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to maintain a consistent design language and user
            experience throughout your project, a comprehensive framework can be
            beneficial. They often come with a unified set of styles,
            components, and design patterns, ensuring a cohesive look and feel
            across different pages and sections of your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comprehensive frameworks typically have built-in support for
            responsive design. They offer responsive grids, responsive
            navigation menus, and responsive utilities that make it easier to
            create websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. If
            your project requires a mobile-friendly and responsive layout, these
            frameworks can save you time and effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you need to quickly prototype a concept or create a minimum
            viable product (MVP), a comprehensive framework can provide a solid
            foundation. The pre-built components and layouts allow you to
            rapidly assemble the necessary features and test your idea without
            spending excessive time on styling and design.
