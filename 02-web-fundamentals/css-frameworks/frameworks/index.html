      <h2>Types of CSS Frameworks</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Classless / Minimalist:</h3>
        <h4>Learning curve: Low, CSS file size: Light</h4>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>
          These frameworks offer a minimal set of styles and components,
          focusing on simplicity and flexibility. They provide a starting point
          for customization rather than a complete UI solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're concerned about page load times and performance, a
          lightweight framework can be beneficial. These frameworks typically
          have smaller file sizes and fewer dependencies, resulting in faster
          loading times for your web pages. They focus on essential styles and
          components, minimizing the impact on performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project Prototyping: When building a quick prototype or proof of
          concept, a lightweight framework can help you get started rapidly. Its
          minimalistic approach allows you to set up a basic structure and
          layout quickly, allowing you to focus more on the core functionality
          or design aspects of your project.

        <h3>Utility-First / Atomic:</h3>
        <h4>
          Learning curve: High, CSS file size: Light (if configured with
          postcss/purgecss)
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>
          </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Atomic CSS libraries follow a modular approach, where styles are
          broken down into small, single-purpose utility classes. These classes
          represent individual styling properties, such as margin, padding,
          typography, colors, and positioning. The primary advantage of atomic
          CSS is that it allows for highly modular and reusable styles. This
          approach is beneficial when you want to create a large number of
          consistent and reusable styles across your project.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are building a custom design system for your project, an atomic
          CSS library can be a valuable tool. Atomic classes provide a shared
          language for defining and applying styles across your design system,
          ensuring visual consistency and ease of maintenance. It allows you to
          create a cohesive set of reusable styles that can be used consistently
          throughout your project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atomic CSS libraries offer a standardized set of utility classes that
          can be easily understood and adopted by a development team. This
          promotes consistency in styling and facilitates collaboration among
          team members, as they can quickly grasp and apply the atomic classes
          without extensive knowledge of CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atomic CSS libraries excel in rapid prototyping scenarios. Since
          atomic classes are focused on specific styling properties, you can
          quickly assemble and apply them to elements without the need to write
          custom CSS rules. This speeds up the prototyping process, allowing you
          to iterate and experiment with different styles and layouts easily.

        <h3>Comprehensive / General Purpose:</h3>
        <h4>
          Learning curve: Mid, CSS file size: Mid-to-heavy, but can be light if
          configured with postcss/purgecss
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These frameworks provide a wide range of pre-designed components,
          layouts, and utility classes for building complete websites or web
          applications. They often include CSS, JavaScript, and sometimes
          additional tools for tasks like responsive design and cross-browser
          compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to maintain a consistent design language and user
          experience throughout your project, a comprehensive framework can be
          beneficial. They often come with a unified set of styles, components,
          and design patterns, ensuring a cohesive look and feel across
          different pages and sections of your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comprehensive frameworks typically have built-in support for
          responsive design. They offer responsive grids, responsive navigation
          menus, and responsive utilities that make it easier to create websites
          that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. If your project
          requires a mobile-friendly and responsive layout, these frameworks can
          save you time and effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need to quickly prototype a concept or create a minimum viable
          product (MVP), a comprehensive framework can provide a solid
          foundation. The pre-built components and layouts allow you to rapidly
          assemble the necessary features and test your idea without spending
          excessive time on styling and design.
